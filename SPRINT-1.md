# PLANNING PHASE:
## Sprint 1: System for Rotation of Cylinder:
### Sub-systems:
1.	Rotation of Cylinder by actuator
2.	Control of the actuator by controlling units
## Identification and detailing of major sub-systems:
### Major sub-systems:
1. Rotation of cylinder by actuators
2. Control of the actuators by controlling units
##Detailing of the major sub-systems:
### 1.	Rotation of Cylinder
The following sub-system is responsible for the rotation mechanism of the Cylinder. It initiates the rotation of Cylinder by providing the required Mechanical energy. Here 3.5 RPM actuator is used.  The speed of the motion is  Controlled by the Arduino Mega 2560.             
### 2.	Control of actuators by the controlling units
The following sub-system controls the rotational speed of the Cylinder. It Mainly consists of Relay. In this sub-system, the motion of the cylindrical object i.e. clockwise and anti-clockwise is controlled by the program  uploaded by the Arduino ide.The speed is controlled is by the Analog output of the Arduino Mega 2560.
