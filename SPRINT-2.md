# Identification and detailing of major sub-systems:
## Major sub-systems:
1.Mounting of drawing tool
2.Movement of timing belt by stepper motor
## Detailing of the major sub-systems:
### 1.Mounting of drawing tool:
Two Aluminium hollow pipes of 13mm are horizontally attached to two 3‚Äù aluminium clamps which are supported and vertically fixed by 6mm screws which 100mm in length. 3 rectangular pieces of 3mm thickness Acrylic sheet which are in dimension of 6 cm in length and 3 cm in width are fixed on Aluminium hollow pipes.
### 2.Movement of timing belt by stepper motor:
12v stepper motor is used for the motion of the timing belt. 65cm of timing belt is fixed at one end to stepper motor and other end is supported by the pulley. L298N stepper motor driver is used for working of stepper motor in collaboration with Arduino Mega 2560.
