For the printing part we have used 4 screws of 6mm thickness which are 100mm in length, two aluminium hollow pipes of 35 cm are supported by two aluminium clamps horizontally. 3 rectangular pieces of 3mm thickness acrylic sheet(6*3cm) are fixed horizontally with the timing belt attached to 12v stepper motor. The marker is fixed above the rectangular Acrylic sheet. 

### Our course project is completed in two sprints.
