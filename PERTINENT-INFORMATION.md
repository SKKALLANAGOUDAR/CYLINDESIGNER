### Stepper Motor:
#### The operation of this motor works on the principle that unlike poles attract each other and like poles repel each other. When the stator windings are excited with a DC supply, it produces magnetic flux and establishes the North and South poles.

### DC motor:
#### The DC motor works over a fair range of voltage. The higher the input voltage more is the RPM (rotations per minute) of the motor. For example, if the motor works in the range of 6-12V, it will have the least RPM at 6V and maximum at 12 V.
#### In terms of voltage, we can put the equation as:
#### RPM= K1 * V, where,
#### K1= induced voltage constant
#### V=voltage applied
