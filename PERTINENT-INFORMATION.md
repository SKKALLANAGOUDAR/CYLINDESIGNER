#### The components include:
### Stepper Motor:
#### The operation of this motor works on the principle that unlike poles attract each other and like poles repel each other. When the stator windings are excited with a DC supply, it produces magnetic flux and establishes the North and South poles.

### DC motor:
#### The DC motor works over a fair range of voltage. The higher the input voltage more is the RPM (rotations per minute) of the motor. For example, if the motor works in the range of 6-12V, it will have the least RPM at 6V and maximum at 12 V.
#### In terms of voltage, we can put the equation as:
#### RPM= K1 * V, where,
#### K1= induced voltage constant
#### V=voltage applied

### Arduino mega: 
An Arduino is actually a microcontroller-based kit which can be either used directly by purchasing from the vendor or can be made at home using the components, owing to its open source hardware feature. It is basically used in communications and in controlling or operating many devices. It was founded by Massimo Banzi and David Cuartillas in 2005.
Arduino Architecture:
Arduinoâ€™s processor basically uses the Harvard architecture where the program code and program data have separate memory. It consists of two memories- Program memory and the data memory. The code is stored in the flash program memory, whereas the data is stored in the data memory. The Atmega328 has 32 KB of flash memory for storing code (of which 0.5 KB is used for the bootloader), 2 KB of SRAM and 1 KB of EEPROM and operates with a clock speed of 16MHz.
