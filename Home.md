 An automatic machine which draws styles and patterns like flower vase, glass bottle on cylindrical objects is needed. In today’s generation there exists different kinds of machines like laser painting machine, 3-d printing machines and manual sketching machine which sketches some of the advertisements, posters and animations on the cylindrical objects.
Our project is to manufacture a machine which sketches different styles and patterns on cylindrical objects with low budget, high efficiency and user friendly.
