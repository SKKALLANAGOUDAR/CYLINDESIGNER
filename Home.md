#GATHERING PERTINENT INFORMATION
 An automatic machine which draws styles and patterns like flower vase, glass bottle on cylindrical objects is needed. In today’s generation there exists different kinds of machines like laser painting machine, 3-d printing machines and manual sketching machine which sketches some of the advertisements, posters and animations on the cylindrical objects.
Our project is to manufacture a machine which sketches different styles and patterns on cylindrical objects with low budget, high efficiency and user friendly.
Below are some links which describe about the existing pattern drawing machines on cylindrical objects:-

## Arduino Uno


The Arduino UNO is a widely used open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits. The board features 14 Digital pins and 6 Analog pins. It is programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment) via a type B USB cable. It can be powered by a USB cable or by an external 9 volt battery, though it accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts. It is also similar to the Arduino Nano and Leonardo
